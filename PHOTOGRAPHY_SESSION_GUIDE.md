**Where:** Manicured gardens, pool area, oceanfront
**Why:**
- Lush greenery
- Architectural elements
- Pool/spa where you spent the day

**Outfit:** Full dinner attire works great

### Option 3: Beach + Resort Combo (BEST!) ‚≠ê

- **5:30-6:00 PM:** Walk to beach for sunset shots
- **Variety:** Get both polished resort shots AND romantic beach sunset

---

## üëî OUTFIT STRATEGY

### For Michael:
- **Option A:** Button-down shirt + nice pants (can roll sleeves)
- **Option B:** Polo + chinos (resort elegant)
- **Bring:** Sport jacket for formal shots, remove for casual beach
- **Shoes:** Nice shoes for resort, can go barefoot on beach

### For John (Birthday Boy!):
- **Same approach:** Dressy but adaptable
- **Colors:** Blues, whites, pastels look great at golden hour
- **Avoid:** Heavy patterns (solid or subtle patterns best)

### Pro Tips:
- **Coordinate colors** (not matching, complementary)
