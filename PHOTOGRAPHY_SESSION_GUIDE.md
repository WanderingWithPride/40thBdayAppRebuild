**Where:** Manicured gardens, pool area, oceanfront
**Why:**
- Lush greenery
- Architectural elements
- Pool/spa where you spent the day

## üëî OUTFIT STRATEGY

### For Michael:
- **Option A:** Button-down shirt + nice pants (can roll sleeves)
- **Option B:** Polo + chinos (resort elegant)
- **Bring:** Sport jacket for formal shots, remove for casual beach
- **Shoes:** Nice shoes for resort, can go barefoot on beach

### For John (Birthday Boy!):
- **Same approach:** Dressy but adaptable
