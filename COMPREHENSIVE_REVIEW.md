## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND & FIXED

### 1. **Missing Error Handling in Database Functions** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Issue:**
All database load/save functions had zero error handling. If the database file didn't exist or any SQL error occurred, the entire app would crash.

**Impact:** HIGH - App would crash on first run or any database error

**Fixed Functions:**
- ✅ `load_custom_activities()` - Now returns [] on error
- ✅ `load_packing_progress()` - Now returns {} on error
- ✅ `load_notes()` - Now returns [] on error
- ✅ `load_john_preferences()` - Now returns {} on error
- ✅ `load_completed_activities()` - Now returns [] on error
- ✅ `load_photos()` - Now returns [] on error
- ✅ `load_notifications()` - Now returns [] on error
- ✅ `save_custom_activity()` - Now returns None on error (instead of crashing)

**Solution:**
```python
def load_custom_activities():
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)
        # ... database operations ...
        return activities
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading custom activities: {e}")
        return []  # Safe fallback
```

**Result:** App now gracefully handles database errors and won't crash

---

### 2. **No File Size Validation on Photo Uploads** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Issue:**
Users could upload massive photo files (100MB+), potentially:
- Exceeding database limits
- Causing memory issues
- Slowing down the app dramatically

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Could cause performance issues and crashes

**Fix Added:**
- 10MB file size limit per photo
- Clear error messages for oversized files
- Failed upload counter
- Per-file error handling

**Code Added:**
```python
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB limit
file_size = uploaded_file.size if hasattr(uploaded_file, 'size') else len(uploaded_file.getvalue())

if file_size > MAX_FILE_SIZE:
    st.warning(f"⚠️ {uploaded_file.name} is too large ({file_size / 1024 / 1024:.1f}MB). Max size is 10MB.")
    failed_count += 1
    continue
```

**Result:** Photo uploads are now safe and performant

---

### 3. **Packing List Progress Calculation Bug** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Issue:**
The packing list progress calculation was counting ALL items in `st.session_state.packing_list`, which includes:
- Packing list items ✓
- Birthday celebration checklist items ✗
- Bucket list items ✗

This made the progress bar show incorrect percentages (e.g., 50% when actually 10% packed).

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Confusing UI, misleading metrics

**Fix:**
```python
# OLD - Counts everything
checked_items = sum(1 for key, value in st.session_state.packing_list.items() if value)

# NEW - Only counts packing list items
checked_items = sum(
    1 for key, value in st.session_state.packing_list.items()
    if value and any(key.startswith(prefix) or key.startswith(f"{prefix}_") for prefix in packing_data.keys())
)
```

**Result:** Progress bar now shows accurate packing completion
