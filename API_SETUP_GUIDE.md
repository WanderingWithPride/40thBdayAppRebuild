## üìù Configure Your App

Once you have your API keys, create a file called `secrets.toml` in the `.streamlit` folder:

### Option A: For Streamlit Cloud (when deployed)

In your Streamlit Cloud dashboard:
1. Go to your app settings
2. Click "Secrets"
3. Add:

```toml
# GitHub Token (for data persistence)
GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_github_token_here"

# Password hash (set your own password, then generate MD5 hash)
TRIP_PASSWORD_HASH = "a5be948874610641149611913c4924e5"

# Weather API (RECOMMENDED)
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY = "your_openweather_key_here"

# Traffic API (OPTIONAL)
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = "your_google_maps_key_here"

# Flight API (OPTIONAL)
AVIATIONSTACK_API_KEY = "your_aviationstack_key_here"
```

### Option B: For Local Testing

Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```bash
# Create the file
touch .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

Then add the same content as above.

---

## ‚úÖ Test Your Setup

After adding API keys, restart your app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### What to Check:

‚úÖ **Weather Page**: Should show real Amelia Island forecast (not sample data)
‚úÖ **Dashboard**: Weather widget should say "OpenWeather" instead of "Sample Data"
‚úÖ **Meals/Activities**: Votes should persist after page refresh
‚úÖ **Travel Intelligence**: Should show "Connected to AviationStack" if configured

---

## üéØ Minimal Setup (Just to Get Started)

If you want to start quickly, just set up these two:

1. **GitHub Token** ‚Üí Data persistence
2. **OpenWeather API** ‚Üí Real weather

The others can wait!

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "No GitHub token found"
- Check that `GITHUB_TOKEN` is in secrets.toml
- Make sure the file is in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
- Restart the app

### "Sample Data" showing in weather
- Check that `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` is in secrets.toml
- Verify the API key is active (may take a few minutes after signup)
- Try in a private/incognito browser window

### API not working after adding key
- Wait 5-10 minutes (APIs need activation time)
- Restart the Streamlit app
- Check API key has no extra spaces
