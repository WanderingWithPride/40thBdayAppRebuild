### FOR MICHAEL (Partner):

**Question: Should Michael also get a facial?**

**Current plan:** Michael relaxes at pool/beach during John's solo treatments

**Alternative:** Michael could add his own facial during John's mani-pedi time (1:30-3:00 PM)

**Options:**
- Men's Facial (50 min): $195 ‚Üí Total spa day becomes $1,110 + gratuity = $1,332
